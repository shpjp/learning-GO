1. If you want to print without a newline, use fmt.Print().
2. If you want to format output (like with variables), use fmt.Printf().
3. Go requires every variable you declare to be used somewhere in your code. If you comment out all uses of a variable, you'll get an error until you use it again or remove the declaration.
